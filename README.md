# 📄 **RAG-Based Document Upload Chatbot**

This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**-based chatbot built with **Streamlit**. It allows users to upload documents, ask queries, and receive context-aware responses from the document data.

## 🚀 **Features**

- **Document Upload**: Supports `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, and `.xlsx` file uploads.
- **Intelligent Responses**: Answers queries using **retrieved document content** and a conversational context.
- **Interactive UI**: A clean and user-friendly interface with a modern dark theme.
- **Chat History**: Maintains query and response history for a seamless conversation.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: Backend logic for processing and retrieving document content.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for the web interface.
- **Custom Libraries**:  
   - `load_documents.py`: Loads and processes uploaded documents.  
   - `gemini.py`: Handles the generation of responses using the RAG approach.  
   - `utils.py`: Manages helper functions like environment setup.
